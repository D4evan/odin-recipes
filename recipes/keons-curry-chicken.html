        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A delicious, easy, curry chicken dish cooked entirely in a slow cooker. It's even better one or two days later, as leftovers. Your family will love it! Serve curry chicken over rice, with naan bread and a salad and you have a wonderful meal (I serve it over brown rice).</p>

            <li>1 tablespoon butter </li>
